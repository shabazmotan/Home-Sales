# Home-Sales
SparkSQL is utilized in this analysis to examine home sales data and extract key metrics related to home prices and view ratings. The analysis involves various steps, including creating temporary views, partitioning the data, caching and uncaching temporary tables, and verifying the successful uncaching of tables. Several SparkSQL queries are executed to address specific questions about the data. For instance, average prices of four-bedroom houses sold each year and average prices of homes with specific features are calculated. The evaluation is based on the creation of Spark DataFrames, generation of temporary tables, partitioning of data, and proper caching and uncaching. The successful execution of SparkSQL queries is also essential for the analysis.
